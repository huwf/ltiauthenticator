# LTI Authenticator

## Deprecated

This project is deprecated.  It worked, just about, but it has implementation logic baked into it so it really shouldn't be used. I'm a better programmer now, and know more about Tornado. I would have done this in a different way. I plan to make a new repo instead, which may get added publicly to GitHub when I get time
